                <p>Some of the content that you see displayed on KnowInDeep is not hosted by KnowInDeep. These “embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in a KnowInDeep page so that it appears to be part of that page. For example YouTube or Vimeo videos, Imgur or Giphy gifs, SoundCloud audio files, Twitter tweets, GitHub code snippets, or Scribd documents that appear within a KnowInDeep post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a KnowInDeep post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, that video appears because of a pointer to files hosted by YouTube, and in turn, YouTube receives data about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch).</p>

                <p>KnowInDeep doesn’t control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they ultimately do with it. So, third-party embeds on KnowInDeep are not covered by this Privacy Policy. They are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service (so, when you watch a YouTube video embedded in a KnowInDeep post, the use of data about your interactions with the video would be covered by YouTube’s privacy policy).</p>

                <p>Some embeds may ask you for personal information, such as submitting your email address, through a form linked to a KnowInDeep post. We do our best to keep bad actors off of KnowInDeep. However, if you choose to submit your information to a third party this way, we don’t know what they may do with it. As explained above, their actions are not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see embedded forms on KnowInDeep asking for your email address or any other personal information. Make sure you understand who you are submitting your information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We suggest that you do not submit your email address or other personal information to any third-party through an embedded form.</p>
